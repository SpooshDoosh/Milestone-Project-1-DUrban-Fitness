# UX
* ## User Stories
  * First Time User Goals:
    * I want to understand the main purpose of the website and find out about the services offered by the company.
    * I want to be able to easily understand and navigate the website.
    * I want to find testimonials from customers.

  * Returning User Goals:
    * I want to find links to social media accounts for easier future contact or to see what updates the company has.
    * I want to be able to contact the company with a general enquiry or for more information about membership.
    * I want to be able to see membership options without having to contact someone.

  * Site Owner Goals:
    * I want the company to be easily found using search engines.
    * I want to bring attention the who we are and what we do.
    * I want site visitors to the site to be able to easily locate the company as well as the contact details easily from the website.
    * I want site visitors to be able to directly contact the company through the website. 

* ## Strategy
  * Is to attract new potential customers to the company, to provide them with information of our services and to provide a point of contact. This is to increase awareness and income.

* ## Scope
  * Provide a clean/smooth UX for users.
  * Provide users with essential information as well as the membership options we have.
  * Provide users with testimonials from customers.
  * Provide a clear point of contact.

* ## Structure
  * Existing Features:
    * Four web pages:
      - Home Page - Users can find a brief description about the company and testimonials.
      - About Us Page - Users can find information about the company's values and services.
      - Join Us Page - Users can see the membership options available.
      - Contact Us Page - Users can contact the company through the contact form or find other points of contact.
      - Thank You Page - Upon successfully submitting contact form, the user will receive a "Thank you" page acknowledging their enquiry and giving details about response times.
    * The website is responsive on all devices.
    * User can find all social media links and contact information within the footer of every page. Social media links open in new tabs.
    * Users will receive a 404 Page on their screen if they attempt to direct to a page which does not exist.
    * Navigation: 
      * User can land on any page of the website and find what they need within 3 clicks.
      * Navigation bar available on every page and has links to every page (excluding "Thank you" page).
      * About Us page has a button which redirects to the Join Us page.
      * Join Us page has a button beneath each membership option that redirects to the Contact Us page.
      * The Send Enquiry button redirects to a "Thank You" page to confirm form submission. From this page the user can navigate throughout the entire website using the navigation bar.
      * User is redirected to Home Page when clicking on the logo.
      * The buttons move the user through the  website in the order of the pages without skipping pages and without inconveniencing the user.


  * Future Features:
    * Add the ability to schedule an induction session for the gym online.
    * Add links to class timetables and live virtual classes to avoid users having to contact the company for these details.
    * Add gym membership payment functionality to allow users to sign themselves up and pay for membership without having to contact the company.
    * Add a sign in page for users to be able to store and view infromation about their gym sessions, classes and track progress.
    * Potentially create an app for the members to access all of their profile information and possibly communicate with other members and staff.
