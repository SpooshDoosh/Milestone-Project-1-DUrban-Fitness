    * I want to understand the main purpose of the website and find out about the services offered by the company.
    * I want to be able to easily understand and navigate the website.
    * I want to find testimonials from customers.

  * Returning User Goals:
    * I want to find links to social media accounts for easier future contact or to see what updates the company has.
    * I want to be able to contact the company with a general enquiry or for more information about membership.
    * I want to be able to see membership options without having to contact someone.

* #### Strategy
  * Is to attract new potential customers to the company, to provide them with information of our services and to provide a point of contact. This is to increase awareness and income.

* #### Scope
